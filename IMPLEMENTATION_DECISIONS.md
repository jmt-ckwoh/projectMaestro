# Project Maestro - Implementation Decisions Log
*Updated: December 2024*

## üéØ **Strategic Implementation Decisions**

This document captures key implementation decisions made during detailed planning sessions to ensure we don't lose critical context and approach decisions.

### **Implementation Sequence & Priorities**

#### **Decision**: Start with Chat Interface + Agent Panel (Parallel Development)
- **Rationale**: Straightforward implementation, immediate value, familiar patterns
- **Alternative Considered**: Visual workspace first (rejected due to UI collaboration complexity)
- **Impact**: Enables rapid user value delivery and learning about agent interaction patterns

#### **Decision**: Visual Workspace - Hierarchical Tree First
- **Rationale**: Simplest data model, easiest collaborative development approach
- **Sequence**: Tree ‚Üí Kanban ‚Üí Journey Map ‚Üí Prioritization Layer
- **Alternative Considered**: Kanban first (rejected as more complex than tree structure)
- **Impact**: Reduces development risk while establishing core data relationships

### **User Experience & Interaction Models**

#### **Decision**: Team Chat Room Model (Not Individual Agent Chats)
- **Experience**: Like Slack/WhatsApp for development team - all agents in one conversation
- **Features**: 
  - Smart agent routing with context awareness
  - Manual @mentions for direct agent targeting
  - Agent personalities in group conversation (not verbose individual outputs)
  - Drill-down views for full LLM thinking/work details
- **Alternative Considered**: Separate chat threads per agent (rejected as less collaborative)
- **‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED**: Epic 1 complete with @mention system, message persistence, and threading

#### **Decision**: @Mention System Implementation Approach
- **Pattern**: Real-time parsing with interactive autocomplete dropdown
- **Features**:
  - Regex-based agent detection (@producer, @architect, @engineer, @qa)
  - Keyboard navigation (arrows, enter/tab, escape)
  - Visual targeting indicators in message history
  - Integration with agent routing through metadata
- **Alternative Considered**: Prefix-based targeting (/producer vs @producer) (rejected as less familiar)
- **Learning**: Users expect familiar social media interaction patterns (Discord/Slack @mentions)
- **Implementation**: Successfully integrated with TypeScript safety, IPC validation, and visual feedback
- **Impact**: Creates natural team dynamics and familiar communication patterns

#### **Decision**: Project-Based Organization (Exclusive Model)
- **Scope**: One project = one complete application
- **Lifecycle**: Long-lived projects (base release ‚Üí updates ‚Üí patches ‚Üí maintenance)
- **Explicitly Rejected**: Session-based or task-based organization optionality
- **Rationale**: Simplicity and focus - avoid scope complexity that dilutes user experience
- **Impact**: Clear mental model for users, simpler data architecture

### **Development Environment & Target Applications**

#### **Decision**: Web Applications Primary, Mobile Secondary, Desktop Tertiary
- **Rationale**: Web easier deployment, broader accessibility; mobile high demand
- **Priority Order**: 
  1. Web Applications (PRIMARY)
  2. Mobile Applications (SECONDARY) 
  3. Desktop Applications (TERTIARY)
- **Research Needed**: Validate with analysis of what people build with AI coding tools
- **Impact**: Focused development effort on highest-value, most accessible platforms

#### **Decision**: Golden Path Demo - "Build a Simple Recipe Manager App"
- **Rationale**: Starting from scratch, clear scope, relatable to non-technical users
- **Complete Workflow**: Idea ‚Üí Requirements ‚Üí Architecture ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Testing
- **Future Demos**: Add login feature, debug performance, mobile version (after core app exists)
- **Alternative Considered**: Debugging/enhancement scenarios (rejected as not showing full capability)
- **Impact**: Demonstrates complete value proposition in realistic scenario

### **Visual UI Development Collaboration Strategy**

#### **Decision**: Component-by-Component with Wireframes First
- **Approach**: 
  - Start with wireframes/mockups in text/markdown form
  - Build data structures before UI components
  - Component-by-component development with frequent feedback
  - Use existing libraries (React DnD, Mantine) vs custom implementation
  - Screenshot-driven iteration cycles
- **Concern Addressed**: How to collaborate effectively on complex visual interfaces
- **Impact**: Reduces risk of major UI rework, enables clear feedback cycles

### **Agent Interaction & Routing**

#### **Decision**: Context-Aware Agent Routing with Manual Override
- **Primary**: Automatic routing based on conversation context and content
- **Secondary**: Manual @mentions for direct agent targeting
- **Agent Responses**: Distinct personalities in team chat, not verbose individual outputs
- **Individual Views**: Drill-down to full LLM thinking when needed
- **Alternative Considered**: Manual agent selection only (rejected as too much user overhead)
- **Impact**: Balances automation with user control, maintains natural conversation flow

#### **Decision**: Agent Personality Display in Team Context
- **Group Chat**: Agents have distinct voices and personalities in conversation
- **Team Dynamics**: Agents communicate with each other naturally, coordinate work
- **Status Display**: Real-time indicators (thinking, coding, idle, coordinating)
- **Individual Access**: Switch to full agent windows for detailed work/thinking
- **Alternative Considered**: All agents respond with full detail (rejected as overwhelming)
- **Impact**: Creates engaging team experience while maintaining access to detail

### **Data Architecture & Persistence**

#### **Decision**: Local-First with Project File Structure
- **Storage**: Similar to VS Code - runs locally, saves to files
- **Projects**: File-based project directories with metadata
- **Memory**: Local storage of agent memories and conversation history
- **Integration**: Connect to external services (GitHub, etc.) as needed
- **Alternative Considered**: Cloud-first architecture (rejected for privacy/complexity)
- **Impact**: Simple deployment, user data control, familiar mental model

### **Technical Implementation Approach**

#### **Decision**: Build Using Our Own Collaborative Patterns (Dogfooding)
- **Approach**: Use structured agent personas, document-driven development, session management in our own development
- **Documentation**: Detailed logging of decisions, implementations, and learning
- **Learning**: Refine collaborative patterns through authentic usage
- **Alternative Considered**: Traditional development approach (rejected as misses learning opportunity)
- **Impact**: Validates approach, provides authentic examples, improves product through usage

#### **Decision**: Phase 4.0 Success Criteria (Clear Definition)
- ‚úÖ User can create new project with "Build Recipe Manager App" scenario
- ‚úÖ Chat with Producer agent in team chat format
- ‚úÖ See other agents respond contextually (basic routing)
- ‚úÖ Switch to individual agent drill-down views
- ‚úÖ Save and resume project work across sessions
- ‚úÖ Agent personalities are distinct and engaging
- **Impact**: Clear milestones for evaluating progress and user value delivery

## üö® **Critical Testing Failures Analysis (2025-06-21)**

### **Runtime Error Detection Failure**
**Issue**: Critical runtime errors were missed during development testing and only discovered through user manual testing.

**Root Cause**: Testing approach focused on visual rendering rather than functional validation.

**Failed Tests**: 
- Missing IPC handlers causing "No handler registered" errors
- React infinite loops causing app crashes
- Duplicate handler registration preventing backend initialization

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created `TESTING_RUNTIME_ERRORS.md` with mandatory runtime testing requirements
- Added `tests/e2e/runtime-errors.electron.spec.ts` for comprehensive error detection
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` with strict testing requirements before commits
- Added `npm run test:critical` script combining contract and runtime tests

**Prevention**: All future development MUST run runtime error tests before commits.

**Decision**: Never ship code without console error monitoring and IPC validation.

## üîç **Research Tasks Identified**

### **Development Environment Analysis**
- **Question**: What types of applications are people building with AI coding tools?
- **Research Areas**:
  - Popular AI coding projects on GitHub and social media
  - Common app types in tutorials and beginner content
  - Framework preferences for beginners vs experienced developers
  - Validation of web-first, mobile-second strategy
- **Purpose**: Validate technology priorities and default environment decisions
