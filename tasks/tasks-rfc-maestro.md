### Test Files
- `src/renderer/components/layout/ThreePanelLayout.test.tsx`
- `src/renderer/stores/agentStore.test.ts`
- `src/main/services/agents/AgentOrchestrator.test.ts`
- `src/main/services/memory/MemoryManager.test.ts`
- `src/main/services/git/GitService.test.ts`

### Notes

- Unit tests should be placed alongside the code files they are testing
- Use `npm test` to run all tests, or `npx jest path/to/specific/test` for individual files
- The current codebase has config files with wrong extensions that need renaming
- Most implementation files are currently empty stubs that need full implementation
