### 📊 **UPDATED PROJECT STATUS**

**Current Status**: ✅ **Agent Foundation Complete** - Ready for UI Implementation
- **TypeScript Errors**: ✅ 0 errors (clean compilation)
- **Agent System**: ✅ 4/4 personas implemented with collaboration workflows
- **Memory System**: ✅ Fully operational with vector storage
- **Architecture**: ✅ Production-ready, scalable foundation

**Next Milestone**: Build three-panel interface that enables non-technical users to manage AI agents through familiar project management workflows.

### 🎯 **IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (Next 2-3 weeks)** - DETAILED BREAKDOWN

**FOCUS**: Chat Interface + Agent Panel implementation (parallel development)

#### **Week 1-2: Core Chat Interface**
1. **Team Chat Room Interface**: Multi-agent conversation UI (like Slack for dev team)
2. **Agent Personality Display**: Distinct agent voices with avatars in single conversation
3. **Basic Agent Routing**: Context-aware responses with manual @mentions
4. **Message Persistence**: Chat history storage and retrieval

#### **Week 2-3: Agent Management Panel**
1. **Agent Status Display**: Real-time agent activity indicators (thinking, coding, idle)
2. **Manual Agent Selection**: Direct @mention and agent targeting capabilities
3. **Drill-Down Views**: Switch to individual agent windows for full LLM output
4. **Basic Agent Configuration**: Personality and behavior customization

#### **Week 3: Project Infrastructure**
1. **Project Data Models**: Core project structure with relationships
2. **Basic Session Management**: Save/restore project state
3. **Conversation Persistence**: Chat history with agent attribution

**SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR PHASE 4.0.1**:
- ✅ User can create new project with "Build Recipe Manager App" scenario
- ✅ Chat with Producer agent in team chat format
- ✅ See other agents respond contextually (basic routing)
- ✅ Switch to individual agent drill-down views
- ✅ Save and resume project work across sessions
- ✅ Agent personalities are distinct and engaging

**COLLABORATION STRATEGY FOR VISUAL UI DEVELOPMENT**:
- Wireframes and mockups in text/markdown form before implementation
- Component-by-component development with frequent feedback cycles
- Use existing libraries (React DnD, Mantine) rather than custom components
- Screenshot-driven iteration and refinement

**RESEARCH TASK**: Analyze what types of applications people are building with AI coding tools
- Popular AI coding projects on GitHub and social media
- Common app types in tutorials and beginner content
- Framework preferences for beginners vs experienced developers
- Validate web-first, mobile-second development environment strategy

**Note**: This phase represents the core user experience that transforms Project Maestro from a technical foundation into a usable product for our target audience of non-technical managers with strong communication skills.
