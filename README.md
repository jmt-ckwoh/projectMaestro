# üé≠ Project Maestro

> A communication-centric code generation environment powered by AI personas

Project Maestro transforms software development from a coding task into a management and collaboration experience. Instead of writing code directly, you guide a specialized team of AI agents through a intuitive "Slack + Trello + Team" interface.

## ‚ú® Vision

**Traditional AI coding tools** require a developer's mindset and technical expertise. **Project Maestro** empowers non-technical users with strong communication and management skills to build software by leading an AI team.

- **User-as-Manager**: You lead, delegate, and coordinate rather than code
- **Communication-First**: Chat-based interaction with personified AI agents  
- **Best Practices Built-In**: Structured workflows ensure quality without technical overhead
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple by default, customizable for power users

## üèóÔ∏è Three-Panel Architecture

### üì± Left Panel: "The Slack"
Chat interface for real-time communication with your AI team:
- Group conversations and direct messaging to specific agents
- Message history and context preservation
- Typing indicators and agent status awareness
- Voice input support for natural "brain dumps"

### üìã Center Panel: "The Trello" 
Project workspace with context-dependent views:
- **Project Board**: Kanban-style task management (Epics ‚Üí Stories ‚Üí Tasks)
- **Architecture**: Visual system design and technical planning
- **Files**: Code browser and file management interface
- **Chat Focus**: Expanded conversation view for detailed discussions

### üë• Right Panel: "The Team"
AI agent roster with live activity monitoring:
- **Producer** üëî: Project manager and facilitator
- **Architect** üèóÔ∏è: System designer and technical strategist  
- **Engineer** ‚ö°: Code generator and implementer
- **QA** üîç: Quality assurance and testing specialist

## ü§ñ AI Agent System

Each agent has specialized capabilities and distinct personalities:

- **Autonomous Coordination**: Agents collaborate without micromanagement
- **State Machine Behavior**: Predictable transitions (Idle ‚Üí Thinking ‚Üí Working ‚Üí Review)
- **Real-Time Status**: Visual indicators show what each agent is doing
- **Memory System**: Multi-tier context (Global, Project, Task levels)
- **BYOK Support**: Bring your own API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **AWS Bedrock Integration** - Working provider with type safety issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Agent Communication** - Protocols implemented with event system bugs

**STATUS**: Core functionality implemented but system is **NOT PRODUCTION READY** due to 100+ TypeScript errors and test failures. See [TEST_PASS_REPORT.md](TEST_PASS_REPORT.md) for details.

### üö® **URGENT: Critical Bug Fixes Required**
- [ ] **TypeScript Compilation** - Fix 100+ compilation errors blocking build
- [ ] **Interface Implementations** - Complete missing domain service methods
- [ ] **Event System** - Fix domain event type mismatches and structure
- [ ] **E2E Test Infrastructure** - Restore Playwright test functionality  
- [ ] **Code Quality** - Resolve 88 ESLint violations and unsafe typing

### ‚è∏Ô∏è **PAUSED: New Development (Until bugs resolved)**
- [ ] **Memory System** - LanceDB vector storage for context and learning
- [ ] **Additional Agents** - Architect, Engineer, and QA specialist implementations
- [ ] **Project Workflow** - Guided initialization and task management
- [ ] **File Operations** - Secure file system integration
- [ ] **Version Control** - Git integration with checkpoint system

### üìã Planned (Phase 3+ - Advanced Features)
- [ ] **AI Provider Integration** (OpenAI, Anthropic, AWS Bedrock)
- [ ] **Advanced Workflows** (Bug triage, code review, testing)
- [ ] **Plugin System** - Extensible agent capabilities
- [ ] **Multi-Project Support** - Portfolio management
- [ ] **Collaboration Features** - Team workspaces and sharing
