## 🚨 **Critical Infrastructure Work (Emergent)**

### **Runtime Error Detection Framework** ✅
**Problem Discovered:**
During Epic 1 implementation, critical runtime errors were discovered through manual testing that weren't caught by existing test suites, causing complete application failure.

**Root Cause:**
- Testing approach focused on visual rendering rather than functional validation
- ES module compatibility issues between Vite and Electron
- Missing IPC handlers causing cascading system failures
- React infinite loops crashing the application

**Comprehensive Solution Implemented:**

#### **Technical Fixes:**
- **ES Module Compatibility**: Updated `vite.config.ts` to output CommonJS for preload script, modified `src/main/index.ts` to load `index.cjs`
- **IPC Infrastructure**: Created `src/main/services/ipc/CoreIPCHandlers.ts` covering all missing operations
- **React Stability**: Fixed infinite loop in `src/renderer/stores/chatStore.ts` through hook restructuring
- **Vector Store**: Resolved LanceDB schema inference issues in `src/main/services/memory/VectorStore.ts`

#### **Testing Framework Overhaul:**
- **Runtime Error Detection**: `tests/e2e/runtime-errors.electron.spec.ts` with comprehensive console error monitoring
- **Documentation**: `TESTING_RUNTIME_ERRORS.md` with mandatory testing requirements
- **CI/CD Integration**: `.github/workflows/runtime-validation.yml` for automated validation
- **Process Integration**: `.github/pull_request_template.md` with mandatory testing checklist
- **npm Scripts**: Added `test:runtime-errors` and `test:critical` for systematic validation

#### **Architecture Updates:**
- **CLAUDE.md**: Integrated strict runtime testing requirements into development workflow
- **Zero Tolerance Policy**: No code commits allowed without passing runtime error tests
- **Error Prevention**: Systematic approach to prevent console errors, IPC failures, React crashes
