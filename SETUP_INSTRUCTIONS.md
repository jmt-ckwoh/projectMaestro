# ðŸš€ Final GitHub Setup Instructions

Based on your details:
- **Organization**: `jamandtea`
- **Username**: `jmt-ckwoh`
- **Repository**: `projectMaestro`

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/organizations/jamandtea/repositories/new
2. **Repository name**: `projectMaestro`
3. **Description**: `A communication-centric code generation environment powered by AI personas`
4. **Visibility**: Private (recommended for development)
5. **Initialize**: Leave unchecked (we already have code)
6. Click **"Create repository"**

## Step 2: Verify/Update Your GitHub Token

Your token might need to be refreshed. Go to:
1. https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Find your token or create a new one
3. **Required scopes**:
   - [x] `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
   - [x] `workflow` (Update GitHub Action workflows)
   - [x] `write:packages` (Upload packages to GitHub Package Registry)
   - [x] `read:org` (Read organization membership)
   - [x] `project` (Full control of projects)

## Step 3: Connect Repository and Push

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /mnt/d/JMT_Github/projectMaestro

# Add the GitHub remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/jamandtea/projectMaestro.git

# Set your git user info (if not already set)
git config user.name "jmt-ckwoh"
git config user.email "your-email@example.com"

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 4: Set Environment Variables

Add to your shell profile (.bashrc, .zshrc, etc.):

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_updated_token_here"
```

Or create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
echo "GITHUB_TOKEN=your_updated_token_here" > .env
```

## Step 5: Test the Workflow System

Once the repository is connected, test our automation:

```bash
# Check status
npm run git:status

# Create a test feature
npm run git:feature test-github-integration

# Make a test commit
echo "# Test" > TEST.md
npm run git:commit "Add test file for GitHub integration" feat

# Push the branch
npm run git:push

# Create a test PR (if GitHub CLI is installed)
npm run git:pr "test: GitHub integration verification" "Testing automated workflow system"
```

## Step 6: Install GitHub CLI (Optional but Recommended)

For automated PR creation:

**Ubuntu/WSL:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gh
```

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install gh
```

**Windows:**
```bash
winget install --id GitHub.cli
```

Then authenticate:
```bash
gh auth login --with-token <<< "your_token_here"
```

## Step 7: Repository Settings (Recommended)

After the repository is created:

1. **Branch Protection**:
   - Go to Settings â†’ Branches
   - Add rule for `main` branch
   - Enable "Require pull request reviews before merging"

2. **Issue Templates**:
   - Go to Settings â†’ Features
   - Set up issue templates for bugs, features, documentation

3. **Project Board**:
   - Go to Projects tab
   - Create a project board for tracking development

## ðŸŽ¯ What to Expect After Setup

Once configured, you'll have:

âœ… **Automated Commits**: Clean, conventional format with co-authorship
âœ… **Feature Branches**: Automatic branch creation and management  
âœ… **Pull Requests**: Automated PR creation with templates
âœ… **Progress Tracking**: Regular commits every 15-30 minutes during development
âœ… **Bug Workflows**: Hotfix branches and immediate fix commits
âœ… **Documentation**: Automatic doc updates and maintenance

## ðŸš¨ If You Need Help

If you encounter issues:

1. **Token Problems**: Regenerate the token with all required scopes
2. **Permission Issues**: Ensure you have admin access to the `jamandtea` organization
3. **Git Errors**: Check that the repository was created successfully
4. **Workflow Issues**: Run `npm run git:status` to debug

## ðŸŽ­ Ready for Development

Once setup is complete, we can immediately start using:

```bash
# Start working on the next major feature
npm run git:feature agent-orchestrator

# Regular development pattern
npm run git:progress "Implementing AI agent coordination service"
npm run git:progress "Adding state machine integration"
npm run git:progress "Testing agent communication patterns"

# Complete the feature
npm run git:complete agent-orchestrator "Core AI coordination and communication system"
```

This will create professional, well-documented commits and PRs automatically!
